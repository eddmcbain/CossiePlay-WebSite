<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong>Edward McBain.<br>
<strong>Login:</strong>jc237128.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The project’s web site is goal is to improve business for CossiePlay by providing a space online that; allows users to sign up for CossiePlay events, and advertises the making and selling of Cosplay Costumes.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Currently about 30 people attend the monthly parties and CossiePlay makes and sells about 4 costumes per week. The CossiePlays website’s success will be evaluated by counting the increase in new party attendents and the number of new costumes made and sold.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>CossiePlay feels that attendance by younger people (ages 15 - 25) specifically needs to encourage. A web site in itself should encourage new attendants among the younger generation as the internet is currently the best tool for researching and applying for events and is mostly used by the target demographic. The webs site should also appeal to the target audience by having an appropriate aesthetic and function that appeals to younger people.</p>
